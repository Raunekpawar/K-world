Project's Title:- K-world


Description:
The KDrama Recommendations System is an ongoing project focused on providing personalized Korean drama (KDrama) suggestions to users. The initial implementation uses a small dataset, and I am actively working on enhancing and expanding the system with more features and a larger dataset. The system employs machine learning techniques to recommend five similar KDramas to the user based on their input.

Features:

1.Personalized Recommendations: The system accepts user input of a KDrama name and recommends five other KDramas with similar characteristics, ensuring personalized and relevant suggestions.

2.Machine Learning Implementation: Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm were utilized to implement machine learning algorithms for content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization to generate accurate and diverse recommendations.

3.Ongoing Development: The project is continually being improved to enhance recommendation accuracy and user experience. Additional features, such as including posters of KDramas, are being explored for future implementation.

Deployment:
The recommendation model is currently being prepared for deployment on a platform such as Heroku. However, due to certain limitations with the premium features on Heroku, the deployment process has been temporarily delayed. If anyone in the team has knowledge of alternative deployment platforms, your insights would be greatly appreciated and helpful in finalizing the deployment phase.

Contributions:
As a software engineer, I welcome contributions from the team to further improve the KDrama Recommendations System. If you are interested in contributing, you can fork the repository, create a new branch, implement your changes, and submit a pull request for thorough review.
